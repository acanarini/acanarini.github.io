## Teaching phylosophy

My teaching philosophy has developed from my personal and professional experiences both in and out of the classroom. I was fortunate to have a strong international academic path (Italy, US, UK, Australia, Austria and Japan) where I encountered dozens of professors in multiple disciplines. Some were great public speakers, some were highly organized, and some exuded confidence and knowledge, without being intimidating or condescending. Some communicated infectious enthusiasm, some encouraged group projects, and some were extremely good at recognizing the different learning modes of students. It was during this time that I learned how teaching might be done well. I was given the opportunity to teach in two courses (during my PhD) and to mentor numerous students during my post-doc experiences, to put in practice what I learnt from my previous experiences. While an international career path often leads to fewer opportunities for teaching, those experiences have been extremely rewarding and helped to shape my view on teaching. I am now looking forward to becoming Associate Professor and to expand the opportunities to teach to students.
