## Supervision phylosophy

As an academic supervisor, my philosophy emphasizes fostering a supportive and collaborative environment that nurtures both academic and personal development. I believe mentorship extends beyond guiding research; it should inspire independent thinking and confidence. Open-mindedness is at the heart of my approach, welcoming diverse cultures and perspectives to enrich discussions and foster creativity. This inclusivity prepares students and researcher for diverse teamwork and global engagement.

I value open communication and see supervision as a two-way exchange, focusing on dialogue to help develop problem-solving and interpersonal skills. By listening actively and providing tailored feedback, I encourage  to recognize strengths and build each person potential.

Rejecting strict hierarchies, I treat students (or young researchers) as colleagues in training who contribute meaningfully to shared research. This approach fosters autonomy, trust, and motivation. Balancing academic rigor with empathy, I aim to create a space where students feel supported both academically and personally. In essence, my supervision philosophy champions inclusivity, open dialogue, and collaboration to advance academic growth and prepare students for impactful careers.
