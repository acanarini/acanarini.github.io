- title: "<h6>Quantifying microbial growth and carbon use efficiency in dry soil environments via 18O water vapor equilibration</h6>"
  image: GCB_fig.png
  description: We developed a unique method that allows for the first time to introduce stable isotope in soil without direct water addition. This has generated enourmous developments for measuring microbial growth in soil, from application to drought studies to intact soil cores, from community level measurements to taxa specific growth rates.

- title: "<h6>Ecological memory of recurrent drought modifies soil processes via changes in soil microbial community</h6>"
  image: EcoMemo_fig.png
  description: We discovered that soil microbial community composition changes in concert with its functioning, with consequences for soil processes. The formation of ecological memory in soil under recurrent drought may enhance the resilience of ecosystem functioning against future drought events.

- title: "<h6>Microbial growth under drought is confined to distinct taxa and modified by potential future climate conditions</h6>"
  image: Denn_fig.png
  description: We applied the vapor equilibration method in combination with the qSIP to obtain taxa-specific growth rates. We found that during drought fewer taxa grow but they sustain high growth rates, and that future climate conditions (higher temperatures and atmospheric CO2) modified these taxa.
